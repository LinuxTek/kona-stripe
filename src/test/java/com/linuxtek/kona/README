By default, the Surefire Plugin will automatically include all 
test classes with the following wildcard patterns:

"**/Test*.java" 
    - includes all of its subdirectories and all java filenames 
    that start with "Test".

"**/*Test.java" 
    - includes all of its subdirectories and all java filenames 
    that end with "Test".

"**/*TestCase.java" 
    - includes all of its subdirectories and all java filenames 
    that end with "TestCase".
